Assignment: Radio Stations on a Music Streaming Platform

In this assignment, you will create a class to represent radio stations available on a music streaming platform. Your class should have attributes for the station's name, genre, and popularity, and methods for displaying the station's information and changing its popularity.

Follow these steps to complete the assignment:

    Fork the provided project on GitHub. The project contains a template file called radio_station.py that you should use to write your code as well as a few examples of OOP concepts.

    Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

    Open the project in PyCharm or your preferred Python IDE.

    In the radio_station.py file, define a class called RadioStation with the following attributes and methods:

        Attributes:
            name: The name of the radio station (e.g. 'Rock Hits', 'Jazz Classics', etc.)
            genre: The genre of the radio station (e.g. 'rock', 'jazz', etc.)
            popularity: The popularity of the radio station (e.g. 1 to 5, with 5 being the most popular)

        Methods:
            __init__(self, name, genre, popularity): Constructor method to initialize the object's attributes.
            display_info(self): Method to display the station's information.
            change_popularity(self, new_popularity): Method to change the station's popularity.

    Create objects of the RadioStation class with different names, genres, and popularity levels.

    Call the display_info and change_popularity methods on the objects to display their information and change their popularity.

    Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

    Submit a link to your forked repository as your assignment.

Tools you should use:

    GitHub: For forking the project and submitting your assignment.
    PyCharm (or any Python IDE of your choice): For writing and testing your code.

Good luck!
